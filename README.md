# Catalog App
This web app is a basic app for showing categories and items.
The web has nice options with user login and authentication.

## Application Running:
Note that once you open the [run.py](https://github.com/walidpiano/CatalogApp/blob/master/run.py):
1. When you open the [localhost](http://127.0.0.1:5000/), the homepage will show up.
2. The homepage shows all ```categories``` and the latest added ```item``` for each one.
3. You can easily show all the ```items``` inside each category by clicking on it.
4. You can also show any ```item``` details by clicking on it.
5. If you need to add, edit, delete any content, you will have to signup (use your name, gmail, and put password).
6. Whenever you need to login, you can use your credentials or either sign up using your ```google``` account.
7. Once you're logged in you have the authority to modify the contents.
8. You can also view all the content in ```json``` if you request [catalog.json](http://127.0.0.1:5000/catalog.json.)
